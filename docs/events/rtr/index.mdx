# RTR Events

Events published by Rapid Transit Realtime (RTR), the service that is responsible for providing predictions for all MBTA subway vehicles. These events all inform consumers (only Glides at the moment) of changes in light rail vehicles.

Related to [RFC-25](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/blob/main/rfcs/accepted/0025-light-rail-trip-model.md).

### lightrail-vehicle-updated

Published periodically to broadcast important information about all light rail vehicles that RTR is tracking.
