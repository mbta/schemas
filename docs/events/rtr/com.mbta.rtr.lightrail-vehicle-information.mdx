# lightrail-vehicle-information

event type: `com.mbta.rtr.lightrail-vehicle-information`.

Message from RTR indicating information about the location and status of light rail vehicles provided by RTR. RTR sources this information from the OCS and/or the vehicle AVLs.

Related to [RFC-25](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/blob/main/rfcs/accepted/0025-light-rail-trip-model.md)

## Data

Fields in the event's `data`:

- `directionId` (integer): Direction in which the vehicle is headed. Derived from the direction in [GTFS's trips.txt](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#tripstxt).
- `lastAvi` (string): The last AVI code that was emitted from the vehicle. If you are internal to the MBTA, see the [RTR documentation on AVI codes](https://github.com/mbta/rtr/blob/f734e361cb7361ec0cde461add8e1e1bfc938b74/docs/avi_codes.pdf)
- `vehicleId` (string): Unique identifier of the vehicle from OCS
- `routeId` (string): Route that RTR thinks the vehicle is serving. See [GTFS's trips.txt](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#tripstxt).
- `consist` (array[string]): Array containing car numbers of the train in order
- `orientation` (enum, values: ["AB", "BA"]): Whether the 'rear' or 'front' of each train is facing forward for each train in the consist. B means backward, A means forward
- `nextStopId` (string): Identifier for the next stop that the vehicle is at / approaching. This will be a stop in GTFS parlance (`location_type = 0`), as opposed to a station (`location_type = 1`). See [GTFS's stops.txt documentation.](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#stopstxt)
- `stopStatus` (enum, values: ["STOPPED_AT", "INCOMING_AT", "IN_TRANSIT_TO"]): What the train is doing in relation to the next stop
- `lat` (string): Most recent latitude of the vehicle
- `lon` (string): Most recent longitude of the vehicle
