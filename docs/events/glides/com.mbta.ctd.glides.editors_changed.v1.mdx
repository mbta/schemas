import EventSchemaPath from "@site/src/components/EventSchemaPath.tsx";

Operator sign in and out of editing specific trainsheets. This event publishes
changes to who is editing. Since one action by an inspector might result in
multiple changes, for example if they sign out of one location and in to
another, the changes are published in a list.

In practice, we limit each location to have only one editor, and limit each
editor to only one location, but that rule may or may not change and this data
in this event doesn't guarantee that.

Note that the author may or may not match the editors in changes, since
inspectors can change whether other people are editing. For example, when an
inspector takes over editing at a location, they may sign out the previous
editor. Then they would issue a stop change for the previous editor and a start
change for themself.

Fields in the event:

- `metadata` (Metadata): how the changes were entered in Glides, including the author.
- `changes` (array of EditorChange): a list of start and stop editing events
