# operator_signed_in

event type: `com.mbta.ctd.glides.operator_signed_in.v1`

At the start of their shift, operators need to confirm in Glides (on an inspector's device) that they are fit-for-duty and do not have any electronic devices.

## Data

Fields in the event's `data`:

- `metadata` ([Metadata](.#metadata)): how the operator was signed in in Glides, including the inspector who signed them in.
- `operator` ([Operator](.#operator)): the operator who signed in
- `signedInAt` (RFC3999 timestamp): the time at which they signed in (this is separate from the event timestamp)
- `signature` ([Signature](#signature)): how the operator signed in.

### Metadata

See [Metadata](.#metadata)

### Operator

See [Operator](.#operator)

### Signature

How the operator signed that they were fit for duty.

Fields:

- `type` (string): How the the operator made their signature.

Current values for `type` are

- `"tap"` if they signed in by tapping their badge to an RFID scanner.
- `"type"` if they signed in by typing their badge number into Glides as a signature.

Represented as an object with a string field instead of `const`s, so that we could include other types of signatures or other data about the signature in the future without a breaking change.

The tapped badge's RFID serial number is not included in the stream for security reasons (it could be used to impersonate an employee).
