At the start of their shift, operators need to confirm that they are
fit-for-duty and do not have any electronic devices. They currently do this by
physically signing a paper trainsheet: in the future, they will do this
digitally.

Fields in the event:

- `metadata` (Metadata): how the operator was signed in in Glides, including the inspector who signed them in.
- `operator` (Operator): the operator who signed in
- `signedInAt` (RFC3999 timestamp): the time at which they signed in (separate from the time of the event)
- `signature` (Signature): how the operator confirmed that they signed in.

Originally described in [RFC18](https://github.com/mbta/technology-docs/blob/main/rfcs/accepted/0018-glides-trainsheet-events.md).
