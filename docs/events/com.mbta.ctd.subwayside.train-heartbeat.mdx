## Crowding

For calculating crowding, the important fields are:

- `/data/leadCarNbr`: the lead car has the operator (one additional person)
- `/data/cars[*]/type`: `CAB` or `NON_CAB` (non-cab cars have a higher capacity)
- `/data/cars[*]/loadWeightLb[*]`: weights from the two MBCU sensors. it's
  possible for one or both of them to be 0.
